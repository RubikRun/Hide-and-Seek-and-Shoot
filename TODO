- BUG0 (stretching bug) (DONE)

- BUG1 (small shape texture bug)
    When shapes (walls) are very small, relative to their texture,
    I want to scale down the texture accordingly.
    Maybe keep some scale factor in the config file

- BUG2 (mouse move while button pressed)
    While a key is pressed, the mouse cannot be moved,
    when using the track pad

- BUG3 (cannot reach map edge with Person)
    When a Person moves, they move with some constant speed,
    hence some velocity vector with always the same length, say 10.
    Then if the Person is say 8 pixels away from a map edge
    and tries to move towards it, it will not move at all,
    because my algorithm will find out that the next position
    would be outside the map and will not move the Person at all.
    However, what I want is not that.
    What I want is, in such cases the Person to move towards an edge,
    but stop at the edge. So technically they will move with a speed
    less than their speed.
