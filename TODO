- BUG0 (stretching bug) (FIXED)

- BUG1 (small shape texture bug)
    When shapes (walls) are very small, relative to their texture,
    I want to scale down the texture accordingly.
    Maybe keep some scale factor in the config file

- BUG2 (mouse move while button pressed) (FIXED, or rather realised it's not a bug in my program)
    While a key is pressed, the mouse cannot be moved,
    when using the track pad

- BUG3 (cannot reach map edge with Person) (FIXED)
    When a Person moves, they move with some constant speed,
    hence some velocity vector with always the same length, say 10.
    Then if the Person is say 8 pixels away from a map edge
    and tries to move towards it, it will not move at all,
    because my algorithm will find out that the next position
    would be outside the map and will not move the Person at all.
    However, what I want is not that.
    What I want is, in such cases the Person to move towards an edge,
    but stop at the edge. So technically they will move with a speed
    less than their speed.

- BUG4 (sprite collision) (FIXED)
    Sprite collision is not very well implemented in SFML.
    It relies on a bounding rectangle parallel to the X and Y axes,
    which is not good enough.
    For now my idea of a fix is to use head sprites that are circular
    and detect collisions with the radius.
    Which is also not ideal, because it forces me to have circular heads,
    but otherwise it would get too complicated.
    Not to say it's not possible, I just don't want to deal with it in this game.
    It is a side project for another time - generic sprite wrapper,
    that can be used to define the sprite bounds to be any complex shape.
