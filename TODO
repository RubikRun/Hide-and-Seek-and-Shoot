- Maybe remove sf::Texture const* members from World class (and maybe other classes).
    because sf::Sprite has a method getTexture() and so keeping a pointer to the texture is redundant.
    I think so. I need to check it through.

- BUG0 (stretching bug) (DONE)

- BUG1 (small shape texture bug)
    When shapes (walls) are very small, relative to their texture,
    I want to scale down the texture accordingly.
    Maybe keep some scale factor in the config file
