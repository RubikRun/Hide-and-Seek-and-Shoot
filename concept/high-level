Hide and Seek and Shoot is a 2D shooter game.

The player has their entity and can move around on a 2D map, viewed from above.
There is also the enemy entity which is chasing the player's entity.
Both the player and the enemy have a gun with which they can shoot at each other.
When one of them gets shot their health points go down until they reach 0, and then of course they die.

The map consists of rectangular walls behind which the player can hide.
The enemy has a field of view which is blocked by the walls,
so the player can hide behind walls and avoid being chased.

The purpose of the game is to run and hide from the enemy,
and try to shoot it while it's not seeing you.
